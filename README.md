# Humidity and temperature sensor

This project aims to collect the data from a humidity and temperature sensor plugged in a raspberrypi and index those data into Elasticsearch and make some alerts with elastalert.

The elasticstack images used are available [here](https://gitlab.comwork.io/oss/elasticstack/elasticstack-arm) in opensource too.

This project is used by the [veggiepi.com](https://www.veggiepi.com) project.
